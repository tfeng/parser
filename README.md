### Parser and source code analyzer for multiple programming languages

A parser and source code analyzer based on [ANTLR 4](http://www.antlr4.org/) 
supporting multiple programming languages.

The parser builds ASTs for languages, such as Java and Java properties files, 
and the analyzer performs semantic analysis on the ASTs. Users of this library 
may extend its analyzer to perform customized analysis and optimization (by 
rewriting ASTs).
